The disruptive role of sharing economies within previously regulated areas of economic life has brought considerable interest in the characteristics of these new market structures. Nevertheless, little emphasis has been placed on understanding the dynamics of discrimination in them. To face this issue, B. Edelman et al. (2017)  use a quasi-experimental approach to identify racial based discrimination in the rental market of Airbnb.

The available data correctly reproduced most of the authors' results, whit exceptions for estimated effects of host tenure, proxied by ownership of multiple listings, over acceptance rates, probably due to mistreatment of missing values and label codification.

While the research presented a relatively internally valid identification strategy, grounded on auditing strategies and randomisation, there are significant issues related to the sampling and data gathering strategy impacting the external validity of the results. Notably, the low number of same-race gender interactions between host and guests limits possible relevant cofounders of intragroup and intergroup discrimination that have proven relevant in areas such as education and socialisation (Hughes et al., 2017; Shrum et al., 1988) and the labour market (Bacharach et al., 2005).  Moreover, the considerable frequency of listings from Los Angeles And Washington and the relative noise in the inferred discrimination effects conditional on listings features and price suggests that the identified effect may be only locally sound.
